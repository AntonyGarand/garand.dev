## Minutes 1-2: Personalize Your Info

Open `src/config.ts` and update the following:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  // ... other config
  author: {
    name: "Your Full Name",
    title: "Your Job Title",
    email: "you@example.com",
    bio: "A short bio about yourself (1-2 sentences)",
    location: "Your City, Country",
  },

  social: {
    github: "https://github.com/your-username",
    linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/your-username",
    twitter: "",
    mastodon: "",
    bluesky: "",
  },
  // ...
};
```

Save the file and refresh your browser. The homepage now displays your name and info!

## Minutes 3-4: Add Your First Project

Create a new file `src/content/projects/my-first-project.mdx`:

```yaml

## Minute 5: See the Results

1. Make sure dev server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)
3. Your new project appears on the homepage (because `featured: true`)
4. Click to view the project detail page

## Removing Sample Content

The theme includes 42 sample files. To start fresh:

```bash
# Remove all sample content
rm -rf src/content/*/*.mdx
```

Or remove by category:

```bash
rm -rf src/content/speaking/*    # If you don't do presentations
rm -rf src/content/decisions/*   # If you don't want decision logs
```

After removing, either:

- Create at least 1 content file in each category you use
- Or hide empty pages by editing navigation in `src/config.ts`
